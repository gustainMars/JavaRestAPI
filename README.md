# JavaRestAPI

A simple REST API using Java with Spring Framework, PostgreSQL, Swagger UI and Maven.

## Why publish this Project/a Project like this one?

  Well, let me tell you a brief story. Well, I received a test from a company that I was applying for a job as a Java developer. So it was a vacancy for Backend Java Developer and, 
to be honest, I don't have much experience in that area with Java. So I looked for a Java REST API development course and found an excellent instructor called Michelli Brito! She 
explains very well and in a simple way, and her courses are available on YouTube!
  Back to the story ^^ ', I took some lessons from her course (I didn't have to take all the video lessons to be able to complete the test), and I managed to deliver it on time.
So, on Monday, I received feedback from the company and, unfortunately, I was not selected. However, it was worth it for the learning I had and this challenge rekindled my passion 
for programming and especially for Java! I decided to finish the course and publish what I learned from him! So, now I want to learn more about Backend Web Development and I will 
look for a job in this area!

## What did I learn from this course (Development of the REST API with Java and Spring Boot + PostgreSQL)?

  Well, I never used Java for Backend Development (at least, not at the level I learned to handle this course). BUT, in my opinion, I believed it would be more difficult! Java is a 
somewhat complex language, compared to PHP, JavaScript, Python and so on (not complex, Java is more structured and is heavily typed, for example). The point is: age has done 
well for Java. It has a lot of libraries and frameworks, and in the case of Spring, I really liked it! The notes for building a database is incredible! I never imagined that 
getting Java to communicate with the database and actually building a table and inserting data into it was so simple (in the sense that, with some commands, you can do it that)! 
And JpaRepository helps a lot! Wow, I reused the selection, insertion, update and deletion methods that already exist in the library, like, I didn't write any SQL commands to 
implement them! The Swagger user interface is very useful for do tests in the web browser, I even managed to use it on my phone! Dude, it's really cool!
  Errors and problems I faced? There were more typos (putting a small letter, forgetting one, or simply using the class instead of the xD object), a problem with the Spring Boot 
version and some dependencies that I needed to add for the save method to work. And that's it, StackOverFlow has never been more useful xDD!
